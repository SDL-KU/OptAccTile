Optimization of multi-core accelerator performance based on accurate performance estimation, Sunwoo Kim, Youngho Seo, Sungkyung Park, and Chester Sungchung Park, IEEE Access, Feb., 2022.\

This algorithm is developed for the performance estimation of multicore accelerators with direct memory access controllers (DMACs). The algorithm predicts a dynamic communication bandwidth of each DMAC based on the runtime state of DMACs, making it possible to estimate the communication amounts handled by DMACs accurately by taking into account the temporal intervals. This algorithm can estimate the performance of a multicore accelerator accurately, regardless of the system communication bandwidth. In addition, the algorithm is used to explore a design space of accelerator core dimensions, and the resulting optimal core dimension provides performance gains compared to the conventional multicore accelerator and single-core accelerator, respectively. This result was also verified by the hardware implementations on Xilinx ZYNQ.

# How to Run

Multi-core accelerator optimization: 
1. Open "opt_tile.m" file in Matlab

2. Edit layer parameters.
 %% parameters\
 mac_units_resource: Number of available MAC (multiplication and accumulation) units
 bram_resource: Maximum available size of on-chip buffer in accelerator (in terms of the numbers of pixels/weights)
 
 target: Target bandwidth
 step: Iteration step size for bandwidths
 
 C_C: Input channels
 M_C: Output channels
 E_C: Height of output feature maps
 F_C: Width of output feature maps
 R_C: Height of filter weights
 S_C: Width of filter weights
 U_C: Stride size
 
 %% assign layers\
 CNN_Layer: Layer numbers for layer parameters in '%% parameters' section
 num_clp: Number of cores in the multi-core accelerator
 
3. Push "F5" to run the Matlab script

4. Check the optimization results
 Performance: variable 'exeCycles' is the execution times for accelerator cores in terms of accelerator clock cycles
 Core dimensions: variable 'A(1)' include the optimiztion results
  A(1).assign_layers: Layer numbers assigned to accelerator cores
  A(1).tm: Tile sizes of output channels for accelerstor cores
  A(1).tc: Tile sizes of input channels for accelerstor cores
  A(1).te: Tile sizes of OFM height for accelerstor cores
  A(1).tf: Tile sizes of OFM width for accelerstor cores
